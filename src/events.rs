// Implements http://rosettacode.org/wiki/Events
//
// Rust uses condition variables (Condvars) for asynchronous event processing.  Each Mutex has a
// list of zero or more Condvars, which are essentially events that the task may wait on or signal
// when it holds the mutex.  When a task begins to wait on a condvar, it enters a waiting state
// until the condvar is signaled by another task, at which point it resumes processing.  Thus, each
// condvar represents an event on which a task may wait.  The one subtlety is that condvar signals
// are only received if there is actually a task waiting on the signal--see the below program for
// an example of how this may be achieved in practice.
